# RT004
Support for NPGR004 (Photorealistic graphics) lecture

## Project plan
Every ''stepNN'' directory refers to one item of the lab plan
(see [row 1 of this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jnkLW1R7_FYD6QcWP1X_a3_xoVFAU-LzF6ErXKNgqVs/edit?usp=sharing))

More details will be provided in this repository. Checkpoint
information will be included in the associated step directories
(e.g. ''step03'' contains definition of the ''Checkpoint 1'' as well).

## src
The src directory contains support files from the lecturer. Default
version uses .NET 7.0, you can use the .NET 6.0 variant if necessary.
